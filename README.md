## Overview

This project aims to develop a live-updating, contactless biometric sensor that can send real-time updates to the user. It intends to create a solution to the limited accessibility and real-time updates of home-use healthcare devices. A radar detects the user's biometrics (heart and breathing rate) and sends it to a live-updating website, which can send alerts if the heart rate is displaying abormal behaviour.
